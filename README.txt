**Gone Pishing**

These phishing systems are taken from
https://github.com/vxunderground/MalwareSourceCode/tree/main/Phishing and dockerized
for container fast deployment. 

Is possible to update the html css php or whatever to appear more credible, or to
randomize themes to be able to add more credibility to the operation, if someone
deploys serveral of these web apps all over the web and get people to believe what
they do.
